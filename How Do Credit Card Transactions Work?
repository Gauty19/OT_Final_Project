Our group, which includes Gautam, Raj, Sanjeev, and Kartheek, is working on the topic "How do Credit Card Transactions Work?"
Throughout our work, we are looking at: 1)the journey from swipe to settlement.
2) Exploring key security features(EVM, CVV, Tokenization).
3) Looking at the common fraud techniques and how to overcome them.
4) We look forward to giving a visual representation of the process + the risks during the process and how to protect yourself from those risks.
We start with the lifecycle of a credit card transaction that includes Authorization, Authentication, Clearing, Settlement, and Reconciliation.
We then move to the security measures taken in credit card transactions, and in this
We looked at why transaction security is important, the common threats in daily leaves and
The security objectives we need to take while making a transactions.
We also looked at the roles of EVM chips, Tokenization, and CVV codes: Card Verification Value.
The way they work, where they are used, and their benefits. 
We went through some of the common fraud techniques as well, which include:
Credit card skimming, Identity theft, and Phishing. 
We then end by giving a visual representation of the full process, which includes:
The risks involved and the solutions to those risks.
