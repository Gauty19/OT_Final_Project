Our group, which includes Gautam, Raj, Sanjeev, and Kartheek, is working on the topic "How do Credit Card Transactions Work?"
Throughout our work, we are looking at: 1) The journey from swipe to settlement.
2) Exploring key security features (EVM, CVV, Tokenization).
3) Looking at the common fraud techniques and how to overcome them.
4) We look forward to giving a visual representation of the process + the risks during the process and how to protect yourself from those risks.
We start with the lifecycle of a credit card transaction that includes Authorization, Authentication, Clearing, Settlement, and Reconciliation.
We then move to the security measures taken in credit card transactions, and in this
We looked at why transaction security is important, the common threats in daily leaves and
The security objectives we need to take while making a transaction.
We also looked at the roles of EVM chips, Tokenization, and CVV codes: Card Verification Value.
The way they work, where they are used, and their benefits.
We went through some of the common fraud techniques as well, which include:
Credit card skimming, Identity theft, and Phishing.
We then end by giving a visual representation of the full process, which includes:
The risks involved, and the solutions to those risks.

Types of Common Fraud Techniques while using a credit card. There are many ways in which fraudsters can hack your credit card details and cause you trouble. Some of them are: 1) Credit Card Skimming, 2) Identity Theft, and 3) Phishing. I will discuss them one by one.

Credit Card Skimming—This is a type of fraud in which fraudsters put a physical device called a skimmer on top of ATMs, gas pumps, and other card readers to capture your credit card information and PIN. These skimmers are hard to detect as they are designed to fit in with the card reader itself.
Some of the common ways to prevent such fraud are checking the card readers carefully whenever you are making a transaction, and using secure card readers with tamper-evident seals and encryption.

Identity Theft— Identity theft, also known as application theft, is a kind of fraud where identity is stolen. This simply means that fraudsters use your personal credit card information to open a new credit card account. While this happens, you do not even know that such fraud has happened. Using such information, they make purchases in your name.
It is very difficult to overcome identity theft because if the fraudster somehow manages to gather your personal information (like PIN) and opens an account, they have already tricked the credit card issuer into believing that they are you. Though it is difficult, with new technologies, like one-step verification or other verification processes, we can stop identity theft.

Phishing— Phishing is one of the most common ways in which fraudsters can hack your credit card details. This is a kind of online scam where the fraudsters send you fake emails or messages, asking you to click on the link they provide in the messages. or asking for things like OTP, your personal information, etc. Once you click on those links or give your OTP or personal information, they use those details to get into your account and make transactions that you are not aware of.
It is very easy not to get tricked by this fraud. But they tempt you to click on those links by sending messages like, "You have won a big lottery amount, click on this link to receive the money." Double-checking the messages and emails and reporting them if they are fake is the best solution.

This week, I worked on understanding and mapping the step-by-step process involved in a credit card transaction. I broke it down into the main stages — from the moment a customer swipes/taps their card to when the payment is approved or declined. The infographic covers:
Authorization – when card details are sent to the bank for approval.
Authentication – where security checks like OTP or CVV are verified.
Clearing – transaction data flows through intermediaries.
Settlement – the final transfer of funds between banks.
Along with this, I highlighted key points where data is vulnerable to security breaches — like during card insertion (risk of skimming), while transmitting details online (phishing risks), or during storage (risk of data leaks or breaches).

The flowchart is visually simple but aims to give a clear overview of both the technical flow and the security weak spots. Next week, I’ll be connecting this visual with the subtopics of fraud for a smoother transition into the rest of the project.


Gautam
In this week, I have worked on two topics of my part "security measures in credit card transactions. Those topics are tokenization and EMV. My workings as follows:
Tokenization---
This part holds the writings about the its description that what is tokenization, how does it work, benefits of tokenization and use of it in different places. While working on this topic, I found it is the wonderful of making transaction safely. I was amazed through its evolvement in performing transaction without exposing the actual card number. Its working style is also safe and trustable for the customer or the merchants.It creats a token through which people can make transaction without letting other know card number.

EMV--
It stands for the Europay, Mastercard and Visa. Although it had many evolutions and still I think it needs to be updated because it has lots of limitations on usage for the making transactions. One should have take care of safe guidelines for its use.

The rest topic I will be working on in the next week like CVV and importance of taking care of security measures in credit card transactions.

A Credit card transaction
Research the lifecycle of a credit card transaction from swipe to settlement

Starting from Swipe or Tap
The cardholder taps, inserts the card, or swipes their credit card at the merchant's Point of Sale (POS) terminal to pay. After the cardholder sends instructions to the machine for authorization. Inserting cards and swiping cards are different methods. Swiping is done in the shopping mall or where customers buy useful products. Another method is to insert cards inside the machine, it’s means the ATM takes instructions from the customer or cardholders

Authorization Request
The POS (Point of Sale) system sends a request through the payment gateway to the merchant bank that processes payments. Sending proper details after inserting the cards inside the machine. In this method, if the password or card is wrong, the system sends a notification to the cardholder regarding the correct information.

Routing Over Card Network
The purchaser initiates the transaction with the card network. Who forwards it to the cardholder's issuing bank, like Visa, MasterCard, and SBI cards, will coordinate with the cardholder.

Issuer's Verification
The bank verifies for fraud, whether the card exists, and whether the customer has available credit by entering passwords or PINs.

Authorization Response
When approved, the issuer responds with an authorization code to the acquirer via the card network, and subsequently to the POS (Point of Sale), the sale is settled at the time.

Temporary Transaction Hold
The total is retained in the cardholder's account (not yet cashed out), waiting for final settlement.

Grouping by Seller
At the end of business, all authorized transactions get accumulated by the merchant and deposited in the bank for settlement.

Clearing and Settlement
The financial institution that receives the money requests the cardholder's bank to send the funds through the card network.
Transfer Money The money is paid by the issuing bank to the acquiring bank (less interchange fees), and the merchant's account is credited with the amount. That amount was cut from particular account holders.
Customer Billing The transaction appears on the cardholder's monthly credit card statement, and then the cardholder pays the bank on or before the due date.

Kartheek
These days, I added some more information to the deliverables part of our project, which included understanding and mapping the full process of how a credit card transaction works.
Like from last week I broke it down into 4 main stages, this week I went deeper into the topic.

Authorization – when the card details are first sent to the bank for approval.

Authentication – where security checks like CVV, OTP, PIN, etc. happen.

Clearing – the stage where transaction details are exchanged between different parties.

Settlement – where the final transfer of money takes place between banks and the merchant gets paid.

I made a flowchart that clearly shows each of these steps in order. It also points out where fraud or data leaks can happen — like when the card is inserted (skimming risk), while the info is being sent online (phishing), or if the data is stored carelessly.

This flowchart will help connect last week's CVV and authentication work with the other part of our project, which is about different types of fraud. It's meant to give a full picture of the transaction journey, and how each part plays a role in security.

Presentation
A Credit card transaction
Research the lifecycle of a credit card transaction from swipe to settlement

In this presentation, understand how to use credit transactions through cards. We got more information behind the scenes, and several fast actions occur when you swipe, insert, or tap your credit card in a business. The retail machine first transmits your card information to their bank, which forwards it to the Visa or Mastercard credit card network. It is then forwarded to your bank, sometimes referred to as the issuing bank, which verifies that you have sufficient funds or credit to complete the transaction. If everything is fine, your bank approves the transaction. Otherwise, it's declined. Along the way, the system also checks security to confirm the card owner is the person using the card. Once approved, the store sends all its settled transactions to its bank at the end of the day, and the actual money is moved from your bank to the store's bank. That final process is called settlement, and you'll see the charge on your credit card statement shortly.

To protect your transactions, there are a few key security features. The first is the little metal chip on your card, known as the EMV chip. It makes it difficult for hackers to repurpose stolen data by generating a fresh, distinct code for each transaction. Tokenization is an additional security measure that substitutes a fictitious number, or token, for your actual card number, particularly when you purchase online or through applications. This keeps your real card number safe. Additionally, by confirming that you are holding the card, the CVV code, a three-digit number on the back of your card, offers an additional degree of security while making transactions online.—provides an extra layer of protection while making purchases online by verifying that you are carrying the card. The two most popular methods are phishing and skimming. The practice of thieves placing tiny, covert devices on ATMs or card machines to obtain your card information as you swipe is known as "skimming." Phishing is the practice of criminals posing as your bank or another reliable source to deceive you into giving over your card information through phony emails, messages, or phone calls. Banks use smart computer systems that get to know your normal spending habits to fight fraud. If something doesn't sound right, like an unusually expensive purchase from far out of your normal area, they might warn you, temporarily freeze the card, or ring you to ask you to confirm the purchase. Banks use artificial intelligence and machine learning to flag fraud very fast. All of these steps make credit card use safer for everyone.
